dataStatement	This May 2006 mosaic rainfall map of the State of Hawaii is a high spatial resolution (~250m) gridded prediction of cumulative rainfall in millimeters from 01 May 2006 to 31 May 2006. This was produced using several climate-aided modified automatic kriging interpolations of a log transformed sum of a monthly rainfall anomaly ratio (observed mm / mean monthly mm) and a constant of 1 (k), for each county extent. This process was done for four individually produced maps of Kauai, Honolulu (Oahu), Maui (Maui, Lanai, Molokai, & Kahoolawe) and Hawaii counties. These kriging processes used 387 unique station locations statewide and their May 2006 recorded and/or estimated rainfall (mm) totals. Please consult each county map meta-data files for more details on map production and accuracy at the county scale. A leave one out cross validation (LOOCV) of the all station data used in all four counties produced individual R-squared values of: 0.89 0.77 0.93 0.87 for Kauai, Honolulu (Oahu), Maui (Maui, Lanai, Molokai, & Kahoolawe) and Hawaii counties respectively. As a whole leave one out cross validation (LOOCV) data from all stations data compared to observed monthly rainfall (mm) produces a statewide R-squared value of: 0.89 meaning overall this May 2006 statewide mosaic monthly rainfall (mm) map is a high quality estimate of monthly rainfall. All maps are subject to change as new data becomes available or unknown errors are corrected in reoccurring versions. Errors in rainfall estimates do vary over space meaning any gridded rainfall value, even on higher quality maps, could still produce incorrect estimates. Check standard error (SE) maps to better understand spatial estimates of prediction error.
